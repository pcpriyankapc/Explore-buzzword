I was always curious to learn artificial intelligence. This word is so much hyped that I always wanted to explore and learn.Even Since we started giving online AI proctored exam I was curious to know its working and logic behind. Now machines talk to each other just like humans, work like humans and take decisions with their own intelligencemachines talk to each other just like humans, work like humans and take decisions with their own intelligence.machines talk to each other just like humans, work like humans and take decisions with their own intelligence.Seems so interesting ! After learning I found AI is not only for engineers. If you want your organization to become better at using AI, this is the course to tell everyone.
In this course I learnt :
The meaning behind common AI terminology, including neural networks, machine learning, deep learning, and data science
- What AI realistically can--and cannot--do
- How to spot opportunities to apply AI to problems in your own organization
- What it feels like to build machine learning and data science projects
- How to work with an AI team and build an AI strategy in your company
- How to navigate ethical and societal discussions surrounding AI
 I found it really interesting and want to explore more !
 Thank You
 Happy Hacking !
